This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```

2. Enter to repository directory

```bash
cd commit-history
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

5. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your [github access token] (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) in the var:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
